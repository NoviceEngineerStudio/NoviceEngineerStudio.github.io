    "work_description_1": "I designed and developed a static business website for Country Hideaway Nail Salon, giving the salon a polished online presence to attract customers, establish credibility, highlight its services and products, and direct visitors to external booking and community platforms. The design was created in Figma, built with the Astro framework, and deployed via GitHub Pages for a fast and reliable delivery pipeline. The site also pulls dynamic pricing information from the owner's Google Sheets.",

    "work_title_2": "Gunsmith's Digital Business Card",
    "work_description_2": "Bearded B******* is an emerging gunsmithing business looking to establish a strong digital presence capable of representing both the craftsmanship and identity behind their work. As a U.S. Army veteran-owned operation, the brand sought a visual aesthetic that reflected strength, grit, and a distinctly military-inspired character. To support those goals, the website was conceptualized and refined through detailed UI/UX design in Figma, then developed using the Astro framework alongside Three.js for dynamic spark particles in the backdrop. The final product was delivered as a lightweight, static site hosted through GitHub Pages, ensuring fast performance, reliable accessibility, and a scalable foundation for future growth."
